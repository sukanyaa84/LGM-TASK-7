# LGM-TASK-7
This project is aimed at creating an ML model that can read handwritten text from images. 
We will be using Tensorflow and Convolutional Neural Network to develop the model.
The dataset to be used is from MNIST under its Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge.

The dataset's link can be found below.
